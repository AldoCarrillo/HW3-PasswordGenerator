# HW3-PasswordGenerator

The Homework 3 is a password generator based in a creteria what is:
1) Uppercase characteres
2) lowercase characteres
3) numbers characteres
4) special characteres

when the program  runs starts with a promp asking for how long is gonna be the password
after that you have to choose the criteria for password what do you want to contain in it
last step is click the button "generate password" to generate in a textbox area the password.

how my program works is take the lenght of the desired password, create an array of that size and star choosing 
a random character based in the criteria, more options selected in the criteria more options the random is gonna
be able to choose.
